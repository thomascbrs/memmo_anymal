class SurfaceProcessing:
    """ Process a list of convex surfaces.
    #### Reduce the incoming surfaces.
    The following method is applied to process each surface:
    1. The vertices received are sorted counterclockwise, duplicates removed.
    2. The number of vertices is reduced using Visvalingam-Wyatt algorithm.
    3. An interior surface is calculated, with a margin parallel to each edge.

    #### Decompose the surfaces to avoid overlapping.
    Projection of the surfaces in X,Y plan and reshape them to avoid overlaying
    using Tesselation algorithm following the method:
    1. Run the list of surfaces starting with the lowest.
    2. Decomposes the lowest surface in set of convex ones by removing the upper surfaces that overlap it.
    (Tesselation algorithm).
    Use one of the 4 methods listed in DECOMPO_type to select/intersect the surfaces.
    3. Delate surface from the list and continue.

    --BASIC (0): Intersect the lowest polygon with all the upper polygon that overlay and keep all remaining
                surfaces.
    --AREA (1): After difference and decomposition with the upper polygons, select only the remining polygon
                whose area is superior to min_area arg.
    --CONVEX (2): Apply the difference with the convex hull of the upper surfaces that intersect, to avoid
                having small surfaces between the upper surfaces.
    --AREA_CONVEX (3): Both 1 and 2 methods.
